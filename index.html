						<h2>Classic Novels</h2>

						<p>Moby Dick by Herman Melville, A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens, Exodus by Leon Uris, The Jungle by Upton Sinclair, Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck: All classics that have been repackaged yet remain unabridged. These are the kind of stories that each stood as a testament to the characterization of a particular era and locale in human history. These are all fictional tales, but they each draw on experiences of real people, real places, and real challenges.</p>

						<h2>Modern Novels</h2>

						<p>There are so many good modern novels. Some of them are retelling of classic tales with a twist. But you have to be especially selective with more modern stories. Some of them are going for shock value with an overly simplistic plot. But there are good ones if you search with an eye for a good plotline that are destined to become classics in their own right. One story that is really fun is Skipping Christmas by John Grisham. It tells of a family that decides not to celebrate Christmas. They forgo the decorations, the tree, and even the shopping.</p>
						<p>The Kranks have a daughter Blair who is heading off with the Peace Corps to work with underprivileged children for two years. Her mom and dad decide that instead of Christmas they will set sail on a Carribean cruise.  It becames a laugh riot as they discover that skipping Christmas is a lot harder than it appears. </p>
